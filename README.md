<h1 align="center">Hotel Management System </h1>

Description:
This project is a console-based hotel management application developed using C# and object-oriented programming principles. The application provides a secure login system to ensure access control, with data persistently stored in files for accurate record-keeping. It incorporates essential OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance to maintain code structure and enhance code reusability.

Features:


 <li>User Roles:</li> The system supports three user roles: admin, manager, and customers. Each role has specific privileges and responsibilities within the application.
  <li>Secure Login:</li> The application requires users to sign in before accessing its functionalities. This ensures data confidentiality and protects sensitive information.
  <li>Admin Functionality:</li> The admin user can manage user passwords and update user salaries. This allows for easy administration and maintenance of user accounts.
  <li>Manager Functionality:</li> The manager can oversee hotel room management, including adding and removing rooms. They can also set discounts for specific rooms, ensuring flexible pricing options.
  <li>Customer Reservations:</li> Customers can make room reservations, view available discounts, and select the duration of their stay. The application calculates the bill accordingly, providing an accurate cost estimation.
  <li>Data Persistence:</li> All user data, room details, and reservation records are stored in files, allowing for permanent storage and retrieval of information.

Future Works:
Expanded User Roles: Adding more user roles such as receptionists, housekeeping staff, and maintenance personnel to enhance the hotel management capabilities.
Reporting and Analytics: Incorporating reporting features to generate insights into reservation patterns, revenue analysis, and occupancy rates.
Payment Integration: Integrating payment gateways to enable online payment for reservations, ensuring a seamless and convenient booking experience.
Room Availability Tracking: Implementing real-time room availability tracking to prevent double bookings and provide accurate information to customers.
UI Enhancement: Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve the user experience and make the application more intuitive and visually appealing.
By developing this hotel management console application, you will gain a solid understanding of OOP concepts in C# and practice their implementation in a real-world scenario. The project provides a foundation for building more advanced and feature-rich hotel management systems in the future.
